# Linguist & Developer

Hello! I'm **Maarten Ymaenik**, a passionate linguist and developer with expertise in a variety of programming languages. While I **main** **Rust**, **C++**, and **Java**, I am proficient in many other languages and enjoy using the right tool for the job. I build efficient, high-performance libraries, tools, and applications with a focus on clean, reliable code.

## My Works

### VXDE - A Rust Library to Parse `.vxd` Files

[**VXDE**](https://github.com/Reanore/vxde) is my most recent open-source project. Itâ€™s a **Rust** library designed to parse `.vxd` files, which are commonly used in games and configurations to store key-value pairs. The library can read and handle `.vxd` files written in plaintext format, offering flexibility for parsing configuration data.

#### Features
- **Plaintext parsing**: VXDE handles `.vxd` files formatted as plain text, ignoring spaces, tabs, and newline characters.
- **Delimiter support**: It supports semicolon (`;`) as the delimiter between key-value pairs.
- **No dependencies**: VXDE has no external dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to integrate into your projects.

You can find the project on [GitHub here](https://github.com/Reanore/vxde).

## My Skillset

- **Rust**: I use Rust for high-performance systems, focusing on memory safety and concurrency.
- **C++**: I leverage C++ for performance-critical applications and systems programming.
- **Java**: I develop cross-platform applications and enterprise software with Java.
- **Other Languages**: I excel in a wide range of programming languages, including but not limited to **Python**, **JavaScript**, **Go**, and **C#**.
